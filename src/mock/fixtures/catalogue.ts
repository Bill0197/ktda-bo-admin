 *
 * with service packages, accounting schemes and tariff domains as reusable
 * objects a product points at. Adding a product is meant to be a data change,

 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHANGE: NAV and AUM stay computed per
 * sub-fund in `fund.ts`. The spec gives each product its own bond ladder and
 * its own NAV; this fund's income and growth variants share one ladder and one
 * published price, and diverge only in what a distribution does (pay cash vs.
 * capitalise). Splitting the published NAV per variant would change every
 * investor-visible number for a modelling nicety, so units are split across
 * the sibling products and the price stays the sub-fund's. Flagged rather than
 * guessed — see "Where the apps and the docs still diverge" in CLAUDE.md. */
